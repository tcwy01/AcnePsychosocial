# Comparing the Psychosocial Impact of Adult Acne versus Adolescent Acne

## Description 
Acne is a common skin condition that affects 95% of people at some point in their lives. With the visible blemishes, acne brings about notable psychosocial impacts, including emotional distress, hinderances to social functioning, and psychiatric comorbidities. When comparing acne in adolescent and adult cohorts, previous research has tended to focus on clinical features and epidemiological differences, with a notable lack of research on differences in psychosocial impacts. Additionally, the limited comparisons between age groups that are available do not reach a consensus. Hence, the current research aims to fill in this gap in the literature, to potentially tailor psychosocial treatment and improve patient outcomes. 

A variety of data analyses will be used to achieve these aims, including descriptive statistical analysis, univariate and multivariate regression analysis, as well as path modelling analysis. 

## Source of data 
The clinical data were derived from Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, Harrogate District Hospital. A series of acne database questionnaires were given to patients, who presented to secondary care for management. Informed consent was obtained, and patient data were anonymised prior to access by the researcher. To maintain data privacy, personal data will not be included in this GitHub repository, however, the researchers may be contacted if access to data is required for reproducibility. 

## Requirements 
This project requires the following Python packages: 
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn
- Missingno

Python (v3.11.9) was used for data cleaning and pre-processing, and Stata (v18.0) was used for statistical analyses.
